            <h2>Rakn 1: The Imitation Game</h2>
            <p>"The Imitation Game", focusing on Alan Turing and his groundbreaking work in computer science.
                His
                contributions to early computing resonate with my love for mathematics and technology. This is a
                compelling historical drama that delves into the life of mathematician Alan Turing and his pivotal role
                in
                breaking
                the Enigma code during World War II. The film, directed by Morten Tyldum, beautifully portrays Turing's
                genius
                and
                the groundbreaking work that led to the development of the early computer. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers
                a
                powerful
                performance as Turing, capturing both his brilliance and personal struggles. "The Imitation Game" is a
                deeply
                moving
                film that celebrates the impact of mathematical innovation and the complexities of Turing's life.</p>

            <h2>Rank 2: Gravity</h2>
            <p>"Gravity" is an exhilarating and visually captivating film that takes you on a breathtaking journey
                through
                space.
                The movie, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, follows astronauts stranded in orbit after a disastrous accident.
                The
                film’s
                stunning special effects and intense atmosphere create a gripping experience. Sandra Bullock’s
                performance is
                both
                powerful and emotional, capturing the struggle for survival in the vastness of space. "Gravity" is a
                remarkable
                cinematic achievement that highlights the resilience of the human spirit.</p>
